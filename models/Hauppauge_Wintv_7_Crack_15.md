If you want to use the WinTV application on multiple computers, you can do so without any problem as long as you connect the same Hauppauge device to each PC. The WinTV application requires an Activation code to run, and this code is linked to the serial number of your TV tuner (or sometimes the MAC address). This means that you can use the same Activation code on different PCs as long as they recognize the same Hauppauge device. You don't need to purchase a new code for each computer.

The WinTV application is a software that allows you to watch and record live TV on your PC. You can also pause, rewind and schedule TV shows with the WinTV application. The WinTV application works with a variety of Hauppauge TV tuners, such as the WinTV-dualHD, the WinTV-quadHD and the WinTV-soloHD.
  
To use the WinTV application, you need to have a Hauppauge device connected to your PC via USB or PCI Express. You also need to have an Activation code that you can obtain from the Hauppauge website or from the CD that came with your device. The Activation code is a 25-digit number that you need to enter when you install the WinTV application for the first time.
  
The Activation code is linked to the serial number of your TV tuner (or sometimes the MAC address). This means that you can use the same Activation code on different PCs as long as they recognize the same Hauppauge device. You don't need to purchase a new code for each computer. However, if you change your Hauppauge device, you will need to get a new Activation code for it.

The WinTV application is compatible with Windows 10, 8 and 7. It supports both analog and digital TV signals, depending on your Hauppauge device. You can also use the WinTV application with a remote control (sold separately) to control the TV functions from a distance.
