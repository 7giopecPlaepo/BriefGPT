## Step 6: Learn some tips and tricks
 
Now that you have installed Native.Instruments.Traktor.DJ.Studio.v2.5.3-H2O, you may want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your DJ sets and make the most of the software. Here are some of the best Traktor tips that will blow your mind and help you rock out at events[^1^]:
 
- Set the correct sample rate: The sample rate determines the quality of the audio output and input. You can set it in the Audio Setup menu under Preferences. The higher the sample rate, the better the sound quality, but also the more CPU power and memory it requires. A good rule of thumb is to match the sample rate of your audio interface or sound card, which is usually 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.
- Choose the right buffer size: The buffer size determines the latency of the audio output and input. You can set it in the Audio Setup menu under Preferences. The lower the buffer size, the lower the latency, but also the more CPU power and memory it requires. A good rule of thumb is to choose a buffer size that gives you a latency of around 10 ms or less, which is acceptable for most DJing situations.
- Configure the output routing: The output routing determines how the audio signals are sent from Traktor to your speakers and headphones. You can configure it in the Output Routing menu under Preferences. The most common setup is to use an external mixer mode, where you assign each deck to a separate output channel on your audio interface or sound card, and then connect them to a hardware mixer. This way, you can use the hardware mixer's EQs, filters, faders, and crossfader to control the mix.
- Turn on loading deck lock: The loading deck lock prevents you from accidentally loading a track onto a playing deck, which could interrupt your mix or cause a trainwreck. You can turn it on in the Loading menu under Preferences. This way, you can only load tracks onto empty or stopped decks, unless you hold down Shift while loading.
- Enable FX in the cue mix: The cue mix determines what you hear in your headphones when you pre-listen to a track or a mix. You can adjust it with the Cue Mix knob on Traktor's mixer section. By default, Traktor does not apply any effects to the cue mix, which means you may hear a different sound than what is playing on the speakers. You can enable FX in the cue mix in the Mixer menu under Preferences. This way, you can hear how your effects sound before applying them to the master output.
- Keep track playing when looping: Traktor has a powerful looping feature that lets you create seamless loops of any length and position on a track. You can activate it with the Loop In and Loop Out buttons on Traktor's deck section. By default, Traktor stops playing a track when you exit a loop, which means you have to press Play again to resume playback. You can change this behavior in the Transport menu under Preferences. By choosing Keep Playing After Loop Exit, Traktor will continue playing a track after you exit a loop.
- Using Beatmasher 2: Beatmasher 2 is one of Traktor's creative effects that lets you chop up and rearrange a track's beats in real time. You can access it from the FX Units section on Traktor's deck section. By adjusting the Rate knob, you can change how fast or slow Beatmasher 2 slices up a track's beats. By adjusting the Size knob, you can change how long or short each slice is. By adjusting the Reverse knob, you can reverse some or all of the slices. By adjusting the Gate knob, you can mute some or all of the slices.

These are just some of the best Traktor tips that will help you improve your DJ sets and have more fun with Native.Instruments.Traktor.DJ.Studio.v2.5.3-H2O. For more tips and tricks, check out some online tutorials or forums dedicated to Traktor users.
